# Dev-Container Template

This repository is my attempot to set up Development Containers for C++ projects.

[TOC]

## Sudoku Solver - A generic C++ Libary
This only serves as an example, to test and show the capabilities of the Dev-Containers.

## Googletest Support
Googletest is supported and integrates well into CMake and CTest.

## Git
The repository is versioned with git.
This works nicely and without configuration with VS Code plugins.
However, tere are some issues with certificates, that are only available in the host OS.

## Doxygen Support

## Multiple Compilers
Currently we support
- GCC/G++ (default)
- Clang/LLVM

## Theme
This Repository uses the 
[Doxygen-Awesome theme](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/).
